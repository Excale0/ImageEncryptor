# ImageEncryptor
A JavaFX application used to encode and decode messages from pictures.

# About The Method
RGB values from pixels are read and converted into a 3 digit quaternary number. Each letter has its own 3 digit quaternary number associated with it and this is used to decode. To encode, the RGB values are slightly altered so that they give the code of the number when decoded.
